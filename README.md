# Diabetes-Prediction-ML-Project-using-SVM
Using SVM (Support vector machine) supervised learning method, we classified and detected diabetes to the Pima Indian diabetes dataset.

 Originally from the National Institute of Diabetes, Gastroenterology and Kidney Disease, the Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset contains information from 768 women living near Phoenix, Arizona, USA. The results tested were diabetes, 258 positive and 500 negative. Therefore, there are target variables (dependence) and eight attributes (TYNECKI, 2018): pregnancy, OGTT (oral glucose tolerance test), blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin, BMI (Body Mass Index), age, pedigree diabetes function.
